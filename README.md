### Flappy Fish Documentation
#### 🧠 Creation Process Overview
- **Goal:** Combine prior lessons into a small playable game after flappy bird using OOP and game states.
   - Try things out and experiment
   - Simple but engaging mechanics
   - Use purely code and no sprite assets
   - Focus on the user experience and game juice

---

#### `📅 Development Timeline`

#### Week 5 — First Prototype
- Worked on provided guided code to make main mechanics work.
  <video src="assets/progress/week3-prototype.mp4" width="480" controls></video>

#### Week 6 — Consultation and Polish

- Tested shapes generated with code to create squish and squash effect.
- Added circles to pipes to make them look more 3D
- Added fishtail and realised that flappy fish sounds like a cool theme.

#### Week 7 — Polish

- Fixed bugs created by the initial circles
- Created a simple state machine for start, play, and game over
- Created bubbles and bubble trail to add more life and game juice to the underwater theme.
- Added speed and vertical movement for the pipes as the score increases to increase difficulty.

  **Polish**
- Refined color palette and visual consistency.
- Added floating start text and pulsing “Press SPACE” message.
- Introduced bubble particle effects and flipped death animation.

### 🎨 Visual Design

The game uses a soft **oceanic palette**:

| Element          | Color                      | RGBA                       |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Fish             | Orange                     | `rgba(255, 169, 77, 1)`    |
| Background Light | Sky Blue                   | `rgba(179, 229, 252, 1)`   |
| Background Deep  | Ocean Blue                 | `rgba(2, 136, 209, 1)`     |
| Pipes            | Seaweed Green              | `rgba(129, 199, 132, 1)`   |
| Bubbles          | Light Blue (varying alpha) | `rgba(200, 230, 255, 0.5)` |
